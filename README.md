# macOS Automation (+ shell scripts & etc.)

These are scripts, services, and other small utilities which I use to make life on macOS easier.

## Repository Layout

This repository is organized as if at the root of a user's home folder. Scripts and other tools are therefore located in subfolders mirroring their home in a typical macOS user's home directory.

## Documentation

Where documentation exists, it's located in a README in each folder, adjacent to the scripts it documents. Shell scripts may contain a header comment describing usage, etc.

## Subsumed Repositories

This repository subsumes the scripts I still use from two older repositories:

- [osx-services](https://github.com/cdzombak/osx-services)
- [omni-applescripts](https://github.com/cdzombak/omni-applescripts)

## License

Where a script includes a link to an original source, that source's license applies. For code written by [@cdzombak](https://github.com/cdzombak/), the MIT license applies (see LICENSE).
