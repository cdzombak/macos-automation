# OS X/macOS Automation

These are scripts, services, and other small utilities which I use to make life on macOS easier. I run them via:

* OS X Services
* [FastScripts](https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/)
* Scripting features built into [OmniGroup](https://www.omnigroup.com/) applications
* CLI in conjunction with other tools

## Repository Layout

This repository is organized as if at the root of a user's home folder. Scripts and other tools are therefore located in subfolders mirroring their home in a typical macOS user's home directory.

## Documentation

Where documentation exists, it's located in a README in each folder, adjacent to the scripts it documents. Shell scripts may contain a header comment describing usage, etc.

## See Also

* [rsync-match](https://github.com/cdzombak/rsync-match) if the canonical source for the `curie-match` script in `~/opt/bin/`.
* [finder-atom](https://github.com/cdzombak/finder-atom) is the canonical source for this script.
* My dotfiles & Hammerspoon configuration â€” not currently online.

## Subsumed Repositories

This repository subsumes the scripts I still use from two older repositories:

* [osx-services](https://github.com/cdzombak/osx-services)
* [omni-applescripts](https://github.com/cdzombak/omni-applescripts)

## License

Where a script includes a link to an original source, that source's license applies. For code written by [@cdzombak](https://github.com/cdzombak/), the WTFPL applies (see LICENSE).
